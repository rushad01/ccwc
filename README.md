### Build Your Own wc Tool

My own version of the Unix command line tool wc using C++.

wc is mainly used for word, line, character, and byte count.

## Building the project
There is no third party dependecy. It's a CMake project. So build it like any other CMake project. This project use C++17. Make sure you have C++17 supported compiler installed.

You can run it like any othe executable from command line.

```
.\ccwc --help
```

Above command will show all supported command.
